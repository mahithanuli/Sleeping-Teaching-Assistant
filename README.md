# Sleeping-Teaching-Assistant
If a student arrives and notices that the TA is sleeping, the student notifies the TA using a semaphore. When the TA finishes helping a student, the TA checks to see if there are students waiting for help in the hallway. If so, the TA helps each of these students in turn.
